Your task is to start building a simple version of this tiney app feature, either as a native app or web app, if preferred.
You might want to consider the following key user stories: 
- As a childcare provider, I’d like to see a list of children who attend my setting including their current register status (signed in or signed out)
- As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to sign in or sign out a child with a single tap from this screen
- As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to see the log of register entries for a specific date
